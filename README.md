# Student_Placement_Clustering
OBJECTIVE:-
The primary objective of this project is to apply unsupervised machine learning (clustering) techniques to group students based on their academic and skill-based attributes, in order to:
•Assess employability readiness of students.
•Identify patterns and similarities among students based on performance metrics.
•Classify students into meaningful groups such as High, Medium, and Low placement potential without relying on labeled data.
•Assist educational institutions and placement cells in providing targeted training and support to specific student groups.
By leveraging K-Means clustering, the project helps in visualizing and understanding student readiness for placement and provides a data-driven approach to improve placement outcomes.
